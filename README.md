# Task-Manager---Workshop
Console program for task managment

Hello fellow coders!

This is my task manager program. It is able to view a list saved in csv format. 
Then, you can add elements, remove and view the elements of the list.
Upon exit, it updates the source file with current list.
For enhanced visibility I have moved some methods to other classes.
Enjoy using my program!
